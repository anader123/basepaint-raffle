## BasePaint Raffle 🎟️

Buy tickets and win a brush for the day! [Deployed Website](https://anader123.github.io/basepaint-raffle/)

BasePaint Raffle is built on top of [BasePaint](https://basepaint.xyz/), a shared onchain pixel canvas. BasePaint has ERC-721 brushes that allow painters to contribute a certain amount of pixels a day.

The raffle contract controls a 1,000 pixel brush. Whoever wins the raffle can use the brush for a day to paint on the canvas. Painters earn ETH proportional to
the number of pixels placed.
